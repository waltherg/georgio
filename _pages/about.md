Hi, I'm Georg Walther and here I blog about all things tech and data that I find interesting.

For lack of creativity, here is a rundown of the tools I use and projects I do.
Maybe someday I'll come up with a more interesting bio.

See more about me on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgwalther/).

## Industry experience

### Data science / machine learning experience

- Rare event (e.g. click, conversion, purchase, email open and reaction, generic user action) prediction from user-level time series data using classical machine learning and deep learning
- User clustering based on web tracking time series data
- Data-driven SEM, display, real-time bidding, and direct marketing optimization
- Time-series anomaly detection and reporting for streamed and batched sensor data
- Agent-based asset trading (reinforcement learning)
- Basket-based recommender systems
- Predictive analytics / forecasting of asset demand based on marketplace user behaviour (big data machine learning)
- Use of high-dimensional acceleration time series data to solve a classification problem
- Causal inference using propensity scores and clustering to estimate treatment effects in high-dimensional acceleration time series data

### DevOps experience

- Implementation of two-tiered deployment CI/CD process for a Python/Django/wagtail app
- Set up scalable Azure-based infrastructure: Terraform templates for instantiation of managed Kubernetes cluster, database backend and virtual network security; Implementation of Kubernetes deployment and service objects as well as ingress resource and controller
